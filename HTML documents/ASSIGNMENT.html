			<em>It all started with my first game, Pokemon.</em> It started of with me watching the show when it premiered in 1998 in America, I was five at the time. In 1999 Pokemon the first Movie 
			<br>
			<br>
			arrived in theaters, with it's great sound track, and one of the best movie quotes of all time:
			
		<blockquote cite="https://www.bustle.com/articles/174885-11-inspiring-pokemon-quotes-to-motivate-you-on-your-journey-to-be-the-very-best">
			"I see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant; it is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are." â€” Mewtwo
			</blockquote>
			The show, first movie,and hearing there was a game as well, blew my six year old mind. Somehow I got my hands on a Nintendo Gameboy, and a copy of Pokemon Blue.

			Even though I could not read at the time I was hooked. More shows came out the following years and some with games of their own. It was the begging of my love for gaming.
